Subject: Assistance Required: RuntimeError in Defoocus Software

Dear Zachysaur,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to seek your assistance regarding an issue I am encountering with Defoocus, your coded software. The error message I am receiving is:

```
RuntimeError: Found no NVIDIA driver on your system. Please check that you have an NVIDIA GPU and installed a driver from http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
```

I initially ran the software successfully on Google Colab, but after closing it and attempting to run it again, I started receiving this error. Unfortunately, I do not have an NVIDIA GPU on my laptop; it only has Intel HD graphics, and I am unable to update it to include an NVIDIA GPU.

Could you please advise on how to resolve this issue or suggest an alternative method to run the software given my hardware limitations?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
